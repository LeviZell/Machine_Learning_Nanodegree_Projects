# README file

## This repository includes projects created during Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Course

This course involved implementing supervised, unsupervised, & reinforcement learning machine 
learning model using Python

Projects List:
  Titanic Survival Guide 
    •	Used Decision Tree to predict the best features that best predicted survival
  Boston Housing Price Predicter 
    •	Implemented Decision Tree Regressor to predict housing prices based on selected features
    •	Used Cross-validation, Grid Search, Complexity Curves, R^2, F1 scoring, Learning Curves, Bias-Variance Tradeoffs
  Building a Student Intervention System
    •	Identify students who might need early intervention before failing to graduate using various supervised learning algorithms
    •	Used data pre-processing & scoring to decide the best supervised learning model– SVM, Gaussian NB, Logistic Regression
  Creating Customer Segments
    •	 Predicted the best delivery service to offer based on customer spending amounts
    •	Used visualization, feature selection, outlier detection, Principle Component Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction, & Clustering
  Smartcab
    •	Designed a reinforcement learning model to simulate and train a cab to reach a destination
