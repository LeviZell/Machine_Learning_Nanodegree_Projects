In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

The reason is that we are trying to \"classify\" students into discrete categories - those who need early intervention before failing to graduate, and those that do not. In the case of regression, prediction is used to determine a continuous value such as time, money, or any non-discrete type value. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "    - SVM's have very broad uses, most notably with non-linear dependent/independent variable relationships. Can be used for discrete categories or continuous values, linear or non-linear kernels. This makes them useful for a large variety of industries, but according to a paper by Asa Ben-Hur and Jason Weston, a classic use case is in bioinformatics sequencing, which requires \"no obvious fixed-dimensional vector space representation.\"\n",
    "    http://pyml.sourceforge.net/doc/howto.pdf\n",
    "    - Some of the downsides of using SVM's are their complexity, which makes them difficult to interpret. This also makes it difficult to choose the appropriate kernel to use to prevent things like overfitting. It also requires large amounts of training time and computational power.\n",
    "    This is a good candidate for this data set because we are trying to categorize the data for our prediction. The data likely doesn't have a linear relationship and therefore the complex transformations used by SVM kernels followed by the complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression\n",
    "    - Since we are looking to more or less divide the data into two groups, whether or not a student will graduate, a linearly separable line may be appropriate if the data is linearly separable. Additionally, it is relatively straight forward and simple to use and variance can be kept low to minimize overfitting. Also, data does not have to be normally distributed. One industry that uses this type of method is in the prediction of failure, particularly business failures:\n",
    "    http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2171511\n",
    "    - This type of model does not perform that well if there isn't a single decision boundary or one underlying cause. To be an effective predictor also requires a large amount of data. Also, if the correct variable isn’t used as predictors for the dependent variable, it will have little predictive value.\n",
    "    - For the student data set, assuming be can identify variables that have the greatest influence on graduation rate, logistic regression may be a simple and highly scoring predictor that will divide or outcome variables into the two classes we are seeking.\n",
    "3. Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes is used for assess the risk of cancer relapse after radiotherapy:\n",
    "    http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167814007005221\n",
    "    - Some advantages of Naive Bayes classifiers have fast training speeds due to their simplicity, they perform well with smaller numbers of samples, quicker than regression, and can be used for classification. \n",
    "    - Some of the disadvantages are that they can't learn interactions between features - assumes conditional independence.  \n",
    "    - For this models, Naive Bayes may be a great way quickly and simply model the smaller sized dataset in our classification problem.\n"

    "It appears the SVM would be the best model to use. Although the training time is larger than the other models - nearly double the Logistic Regression and nine times the Naive Bayes - it has the highest F1 score for the training and testing set. It does appear that the Logistic Regression is improving with greater data and may be a better model if there is more, however based on our training size the SVM appears to be greater with our initial tests. With some modifications though one could prove to be superior. The Naive Bayes appears to continuing to converge to an even lower score, lower than both of the other models and therefore does not appear to be the best one to choose."

    "How Support Vector Machines (SVM's) works is they find the points in a dataset that are the more difficult ones to classify. This weights the data points differently, optimizing the algorithm in a way classifiers that weight all points the same can't do. This approach finds the best line and makes a prediction by separating the data by finding points in different classes that are closest together and making a line that is the maximum distance between them. \n",

Plotting these features against graduation rate will hopefully show a way for a boundary line to be drawn that not only separates them, but also with a line that maximizes the margin between data points with different graduation rates. An example is shown below:\n",

I also adjusted the parameters I was using because it seemed to take way too long with the number I was using. In the end the best I could get was my untuned score with a training test size of 300. Any feedback on how to improve this to a better score would be extremely helpful. Thanks! "
