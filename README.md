# Machine_Learning_Nanodegree_Projects
<br />

###This repository includes projects created during Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Course


This course involved implementing supervised, unsupervised, & reinforcement learning machine 
learning model using Python


Projects List:<br />
    Titanic Survival Guide <br />
        •	Used Decision Tree to predict the best features that best predicted survival<br />
    Boston Housing Price Predicter <br />
        •	Implemented Decision Tree Regressor to predict housing prices based on selected features<br />
        •	Used Cross-validation, Grid Search, Complexity Curves, R^2, F1 scoring, Learning Curves, Bias-Variance Tradeoffs<br />
    Building a Student Intervention System<br />
        •	Identify students who might need early intervention before failing to graduate using various supervised learning algorithms
        •	Used data pre-processing & scoring to decide the best supervised learning model– SVM, Gaussian NB, Logistic Regression<br />
    Creating Customer Segments<br />
        •	 Predicted the best delivery service to offer based on customer spending amounts<br />
        •	Used visualization, feature selection, outlier detection, Principle Component Analysis, Dimensionality Reduction, & Clustering
    Smartcab<br />
        •	Designed a reinforcement learning model to simulate and train a cab to reach a destination<br />
